# Counting-Vehicle-Python

This project allows the recognition and counting of different vehicles on video. It uses a convolutional neural network called YOLO (You Only Look Once) to do the idendification of vehicles.
I used Tkinter for the graphical interface and the Opencv framework to use the YOLO network.
